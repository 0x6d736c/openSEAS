<!--General format guidelines:
    -- Projects in this repository are intended to offer students (and casual observers) a way to break into contributing to open source.
    -- The projects included MUST be ones which you feel would provide students an opportunity to fork, commit, and make a PR.
    -- This applies to both student-led projects and general interesting FOSS you find around the web.

//Student-Led Project Example:
//Enter a brief description of the project below, in plaintext. No special Markdown bits.
//Optional: list project technologies used between asterisks to let users find projects they can contribute to easier.
    * [My Project](https://example.com) -- Created by [Student McStudentFace](https://github.com/enterProfileLinkHere) | use commas if multiple contributors/team project

//Optional: list project technologies used between asterisks to let users find projects they can contribute to easier.
